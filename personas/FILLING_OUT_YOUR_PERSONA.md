# How to Fill Out Your Persona Profile

## What is this for?

This persona profile will be used to test how well AI models can predict your preferences and shopping decisions. The more accurate and honest you are, the more interesting the results will be!

## Which Template Should I Use?

**Choose one:**

1. **QUICKSTART_persona.yaml** - Quick version (~10 minutes)
   - Use this if you want to get started fast
   - You can always add more details later

2. **TEMPLATE_persona.yaml** - Detailed version (~20-30 minutes)
   - Use this for more accurate predictions
   - Has lots of examples and guidance
   - Recommended if you have time

## Getting Started

1. **Copy the template:**
   - Make a copy of either template
   - Name it something like: `yourname_persona.yaml`
   - Example: `sarah_persona.yaml` or `john_smith_persona.yaml`

2. **Fill it out honestly:**
   - There are no "right" or "wrong" answers
   - Be authentic - the AI will try to predict YOUR preferences
   - It's okay if you have contradictions (we all do!)

3. **Save your file:**
   - Keep it in the `personas/` folder
   - Make sure it ends with `.yaml`

## Tips for Each Section

### Name & ID
- **Name**: Use your first name or a nickname + a brief descriptor
  - Examples: "Sarah - Book Lover", "Mike - Outdoor Dad", "Jamie"
- **ID**: Keep it simple and unique
  - Examples: "sarah_001", "mike_dad_001", "jamie_2024"

### Demographics
- Just the basics: age, gender, location, job, income level
- **Income level** can be general: "low", "middle", "upper"
- **Family** (optional): "single", "married", "has 2 kids", etc.

### Personality Traits
- Pick 4-6 words that describe you
- Think: What would your friends say about you?
- Examples: organized, spontaneous, analytical, creative, practical, cautious, adventurous

### Values
- What's most important to you in life?
- Examples: family, career, financial security, sustainability, health, adventure, tradition

### Interests
- Your hobbies, passions, what you do for fun
- 5-10 items is perfect
- Be specific! "hiking" is better than "outdoors"

### Shopping Behavior

This is the most important section!

**Research Style**: How do you research before buying?
- Do you read reviews? Ask friends? Compare prices? Go to stores?
- Example: "I watch YouTube reviews and read Reddit threads"

**Price Sensitivity**: How much do you care about price?
- high = always looking for deals
- medium = willing to pay more for quality
- low = price rarely matters if quality is good

**Brand Loyalty**: Do you stick with brands you know?
- high = I always buy the same brands
- moderate = I have favorites but I'm open to trying new things
- low = I don't care about brands at all

**Decision Factors**: What matters when you buy something?
- Rank or list: price, quality, reviews, brand, features, sustainability, convenience, design, etc.
- Top 4-5 factors is good

**Purchase Frequency**: How often do you buy non-essential stuff?
- frequent = I shop regularly, enjoy buying things
- moderate = I shop when needed or for occasions
- infrequent = Only when necessary or very planned out

### Product Preferences

**Electronics**: How do you approach buying tech?
- Latest and greatest? Mid-range reliable? Basic and cheap? Premium that lasts?

**Brands Loved**: What brands do you regularly buy or admire?
- List 3-10 brands across any categories
- Can be tech, clothes, stores, cars, anything!

**Brands Avoided**: Any brands or types of companies you avoid?
- Optional - skip if you don't have strong feelings
- Examples: fast fashion, luxury brands, companies with bad practices

### Behavioral Notes

This is your chance to paint a picture of your shopping personality!

**Write 1-3 paragraphs about:**
- How you make purchase decisions
- What gets you excited about buying something
- What stops you from buying
- Any recent purchase and why you chose it
- Your shopping quirks or patterns

**Don't overthink it** - just write naturally like you're describing yourself to a friend.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I'm inconsistent?**
A: That's normal! Maybe you're budget-conscious for groceries but splurge on hobbies. Just describe both behaviors in the behavioral notes.

**Q: Should I include private information?**
A: No! Don't include specific income numbers, addresses, or anything you wouldn't share publicly. Keep it general.

**Q: Can I update this later?**
A: Yes! You can always refine your persona file as you think of more details.

**Q: What if I don't have strong brand preferences?**
A: That's fine! Just say "no strong brand preferences" or list general types like "budget brands" or "reliable mid-range brands"

**Q: How long should this take?**
A: Quick version: 10-15 minutes
  Detailed version: 20-30 minutes
  
  Take your time - the quality of predictions depends on the quality of your profile!

## Examples

Check out these example personas in the `personas/` folder for inspiration:
- `example_tech_enthusiast.yaml` - Tech-savvy early adopter
- `example_budget_conscious.yaml` - Practical budget-focused parent  
- `example_minimalist.yaml` - Sustainability-focused minimalist

## What Happens Next?

Once you fill out your persona:
1. The AI will be given product scenarios and questions
2. It will try to predict what you would choose or how you'd rate things
3. You'll be asked the same questions in a survey
4. We'll compare how accurate the AI predictions were!

This helps understand how well AI can model human preferences and decision-making.
