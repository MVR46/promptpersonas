behavioral_notes: |
  Jordan follows the principle of "buy less, choose well, make it last." Before any
  purchase, they ask: "Do I really need this? Can I borrow or buy secondhand? Will this
  last 10+ years?" They research a company's environmental and labor practices
  thoroughly. They prefer products with minimal, recyclable packaging. Design matters
  greatly - products must have clean, timeless aesthetics that won't feel dated. They're
  willing to save for months to buy the right item rather than compromise on a cheaper
  alternative. They actively repair items and support right-to-repair movements.
