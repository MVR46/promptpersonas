behavioral_notes: |
  [Write 1-2 paragraphs describing your shopping personality and decision-making process]
  
  Think about:
  - Do you make impulse purchases or plan carefully?
  - What makes you excited about a product?
  - What would make you NOT buy something?
  - Are there any unique quirks about how you shop?
  - What's a recent purchase you made and why did you choose it?
  - How do online reviews influence you?
  - Do you prefer online or in-store shopping?
  
  Example: "I tend to research products extensively before buying, often spending hours
  reading reviews and comparing specs. I'm willing to wait for sales but if I really
  want something, I'll pay full price. I care a lot about sustainability and will pay
  more for eco-friendly options. Once I find a product I like, I often recommend it to
  friends and family. I'm skeptical of marketing hype and prefer products with genuine
  utility over flashy features."

# TIPS FOR FILLING THIS OUT:
# 1. Be honest - there are no "right" answers
# 2. Think about your last few purchases and what drove those decisions
# 3. Ask yourself: "What would my friends say about my shopping habits?"
# 4. It's okay to have contradictions (e.g., budget-conscious but splurges on hobbies)
# 5. The more specific you are, the better the predictions will be
# 6. Save this file as: personas/[yourname]_persona.yaml
